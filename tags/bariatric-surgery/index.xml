&lt;p>Bariatric surgery (BAR) has become a popular treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) which is among the most critical obesity-related comorbidities. Patients who have bariatric surgery are exposed to complications after surgery. Furthermore, the mid- to long-term complications after bariatric surgery can be deadly and increase the complexity of managing the safety of these operations and healthcare costs. We propose the use of imbalanced classification techniques to tackle the imbalanced bariatric surgery data, including Random Forest, Bagging, and AdaBoost. Moreover, we improve classification performance through feature selection methods like Chi-Squared, Information Gain, and Correlation-based feature selection (CFS).&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
